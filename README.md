# FEWZ calculation for DY reweighting

## Motivation

To produce the NNLO cross sections in 3-dimentions: dilepton (pT, rapidity) in each dimuon mass range

And this result will be used for reweighting NLO DY samples



## Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:KyeongPil-Lee/FEWZTool.git -b v01_Reweighting v01_Reweighting
cd v01_Reweighting

source setup.sh
```
